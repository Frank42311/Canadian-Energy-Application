"Table Corrections:"
Date,Note
"2023-02-08","On February 8, 2023, the values for Gross withdrawals of natural gas have been corrected for the months October and November, 2022 for the province of Saskatchewan and for Canada."



Footnotes:
1,"Changes have been made to the content and methodology of the Monthly Supply and Disposition of Natural Gas. These new changes have resulted in the creation of table 25-10-0055. Consequently, the information in this table is no longer directly comparable with information that was previously made available in table 25-10-0047. This historical table will remain available for historical revisions."
2,"Totals may not equal the sum of their parts due to the use of conversion factors or rounding of fractions to whole numbers.
"
3,"Total marketable gas production includes gas received from fields and processing or reprocessing plants after deducting volumes from re-injection, field uses, processing and reprocessing plant shrinkage, plant use and losses."
4,"Imports include all natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) entering a region at the Canadian / United States border. It may include natural gas destined for re-export."
5,"Industrial consumption includes all natural gas delivered by pipeline systems to industrial consumers. It excludes natural gas consumed in the natural gas extraction process. It may also exclude associated gas consumed in the extraction of oil and oilsands."
6,"Exports include all natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exiting a region at the Canadian / United States border. It may include natural gas destined for re-import."
