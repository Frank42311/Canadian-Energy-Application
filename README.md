This is an intelligent web analysis tool integrated with multimodal AI technologies. The primary technologies and AI tools it encompasses include FastAPI, React, Power BI (DAX, M), NLTK, DL/Statistical Algorithms, and GPT-4.

Algorithms: The project utilizes several key algorithms such as KeyBERT, FinancialBERT-Sentiment-Analysis, bart-large-cnn, facebook/bart-base, gpt-3.5-1106, and gpt-4, llama2-7B, SARIMA for various purposes including keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, summarization, and more.

The requirements.txt at the root contains the Conda environment necessary to run the entire project.

Under the news_process directory, you'll find scripts for crawling, cleaning, summarizing, and computing keywords for news data.

The statistic_tables directory is dedicated to cleaning and integrating statistical tables, making them ready for presentation in Power BI.

For samples of completed works, you can visit the powerbi_reports, reports, and video directories. Additional resources and examples of deep learning applications can be found at https://www.frank42311.ca/post/deep-learning.

The contents under the Web directory comprise the complete code for the web application, which is also equipped with a separate Docker environment. This can be accessed by pulling fuwanghe/canadian_energy:v1.2.
